# Consumer Driven Contracts testing using Pact:

## Summary: 
1. **Pact** files are contracts that are created on the Consumer side.
2. The Pact files are created once Consumer side tests are run successfully.
3. Pact file contains **Interactions** which are the contracts between the **Consumers** and **Providers**
4. Pact files are named using the consumer_name-provider_name, also application version can be added.
5. Location of Pact files generated by the Consumer side can be altered using Surefire config settings in the maven POM.
6. Pact files are created using - `mvn test` (for maven jvm projects).
7. After creating the Pact files, the files need to be sent to the Pact broker or Provider code repo.
8. In the Provider side, the unit tests can be written after invoking the Provider Application.
9. Gradle tasks can be written to publish pact files to pact brokers - using the pact-broker hosted url - also these pacts can be tagged.
10. Input States expectations for the Provider can be stated on the Consumer side using **given**, and those given states can be implemented in the provider side using @State("state name in `given` in consumer")

## Steps for CDC
1. Create Pact contracts between Consumer and Producer.
2. Create Consumer side Pact tests.
3. Run the tests using `mvn test`, this will create the pact files in the directory defined in the pom.xml.
4. Provide the pact files to the provider, for provider side pact tests execution.
5. To publish pacts to the Pact Broker - 
    a. Update the Pact Broker URL in the POM file.
    b. `mvn pact:publish`
